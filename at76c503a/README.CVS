This driver is no longer developed in CVS.  Please use git to obtain the
current sources:

git-clone http://git.80211libre.org/at76_usb.git

This repository is synchronized with the git repository from time to
time, but it may be removed at any time.

The main objective right now is to get the driver into the kernel, not
to maintain compatibility with older kernels and not to make standalone
releases.  Thank you for understanding.
