- added switch to cope with Intersil firmware 0.84.0 which does
  not send FCS in rx data
- new module at76c503-rfmd-acc.o for SMC2664W, which got RMFD radio,
  but need a special firmware (Accton OEM products).
- added regulatory domains MKK1 and Israel
- added rudimentary ethtool support for SuSE's future hotplug
- added nickname ioctl for iwconfig
- added test of valid channel in reg. domain
- added big endian patch (by Kevin Cernekee), changed defines in
  ieee802_11.h
- suppress unsupported iwconfig modes (monitor, master) - patch by
  Pavel Roskin

version 0.10 (2003-06-01)
------------
- added iwpriv commands to set scan channel times,
  scan mode; added module parameters for all iwpriv
  commands
- debug output is now controlled by a bit mask,
  see DBG_* defines in at76c503.c
- added tx data padding (Stavros advised to do so)
- added rx data fragmentation support
- added power management support
- new iwpriv cmd "list_bss" to dump the current bss table
  to syslog
- fixed error when the driver gets reloaded and
  the device kept powered for firmware 0.100.x, 1.101.y
- fixed hanging of SMP kernels
- new params set with iwconfig get active immediately,
  no need to bring the netdevice down/up anymore
- bss table is no longer limited in size (solves problem
  at crowded places, e.g. CeBIT), old entries get removed
- added iwspy support
- Tim's "link level patch"
- added iwpriv commands for preamble type
- added shared secret authentication (incl. iwpriv command)
- support hidden SSID, fixed bug with ANY SSID
- Alex' "first phase of rx optimization" patch (email 2003-02-23)
- Alex' deprecation patch (email 2003-02-21)

version 0.9 (2003-03-21)
-----------
- taken from Oliver's website


version 0.8 (2003-02-13)
------------
- scan mode implemented by jal
- infra structure mode by jal
- some small cleanups (removed dead code)

version 0.7 (2003-01-30)
------------
- now works with fw 0.100.2 (solution was: wait for completion
  of commands)
- setting MAC address now works (thx to a small fix by jal)
- it turned out that promisc. mode is not possible. The firmware
  does not allow it. I hope that it will be implemented in a future
  version.

version 0.6 (2003-01-28)
------------
- make it compile with kernel < 2.4.20 (there is no owner field
  in struct usb_driver)
- fixed a small bug for the module param eth_name
- do not use GFP_DMA, GFP_KERNEL is enough
- no down() in _tx() because that's in interrupt. Use
  spin_lock_irq() instead
- should not stop net queue on urb errors
- cleanup in ioctl(): locked it altogether, this makes it easier
  to maintain
- tried to implement promisc. mode: does not work with this device
- tried to implement setting mac address: does not
  seem to work with this device
- now use fw version 0.90.2 #140 (prev. was #93). Does not help...

version 0.5 (2003-01-27)
------------
- implemented WEP. Thanks to jal
- added frag and rts ioctl calls (jal again)
- module parameter to give names other than eth

version 0.4 (2003-01-19)
------------
- use usbdfu for the internal firmware

version 0.3 (2003-01-10)
------------
- now using 8 spaces for tab indentations
- added tx rate settings (patch from Joerg Albert (jal))
- created functions for mib settings

version 0.2 (2003-01-08)
------------
- moved rx code into tasklet
- added locking in keventd handler
- support big endian in ieee802_11.h
- external firmware downloader now in this module

version 0.1 (2003-01-07)
------------
- first release

2002_12_31
------------
- first ping, ah-hoc mode works, fw version 0.90.2 only
