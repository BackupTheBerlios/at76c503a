at76c503 - linux driver for Atmel at76c503 based usb wlan adapters
------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a another driver for the Atmel based USB WLAN adaptors. I am
developing this driver in private. I am not associated with Atmel, or
any cooperation that builds devices with this chip. My only
information source is the driver from
http://atmelwlandriver.sourceforge.net.

Known devices with this chip are:
- Belkin F5D6050
- Dynalink/Askey WLL013
- Linksys WUSB11 v2.6
- Netgear MA101B

It is early in development. Currently, it has some limitations:

- to change the essid or channel, the network has to be restarted
  (with ifconfig)

If you are looking for a more complete driver, look at
http://atmelwlandriver.sourceforge.net.

Reqirements:
------------

- Kernel 2.4.x. I am developing the driver on 2.4.20, but it
  reportedly also works on 2.4.19, 2.4.18 and 2.4.16. I am not sure
  about 2.5.x.

Installation:
-------------

make
make install

Running:
--------

Plug in the adapter. If you already used it under Windows or with the
driver from atmelwlandriver.sourceforge.net, replug the device
(ie. plug out and in again).

If you have hotplug installed, the drivers should now be loaded. If not,
load them by hand:

modprobe -v at76c503
or
insmod usbdfu.o; insmod at76c503

You can give the network device another name than eth by giving
the module the eth_name parameter. Eg.
insmod at76c50.o eth_name=wlan%d
would give the first device the name wlan0, the second wlan1 etc...

Check if the modules are loaded with lsmod. It should look like this:

...
at76c503               49972   0 
usbdfu                  6164   0  [at76c503]
...

setup networking (replace <iface> with eth0, eth1, ..., <ch> with a
channel number (1..14) <essid> with your network id (a string), <ip>
with an IP address)

iwconfig <iface> channel <ch> mode ad-hoc essid <essid>
ifonfig <iface> <ip> up

Example:
iwconfig eth2 mode ad-hoc channel 10 essid okuwlan
ifconfig eth2 192.168.3.1 up

Test it by pinging another host with a wlan adaptor.

To change a parameter with iwconfig, do:
ifconfig <iface> down
iwconfig ...
ifconfig <iface> up

Note that the firmware survives reboots of the computer, but not
unplugging the device.

If you get problems:
Look with dmesg, if there are error messages
