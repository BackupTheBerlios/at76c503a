	* at76c503a/: at76c503.c, at76c503.h: assume WIRELESS_EXT >= 16

2006-06-22 23:21  agx

	* at76c503a/at76c503.c: fix compilation for WE >19

2006-06-22 22:58  agx

	* at76c503a/at76c503.c: use iwreq_data instead of iw_point in
	  at76c503_iw_handler_set_scan as the ipw2X00 drivers do

	* at76c503a/at76c503.c: Pavel Roskin <proski@gnu.org>:

	  Scanning doesn't work when the interface is down.  When it's
	  brought up, the driver reports two assertion failures:

	  /home/proski/src/at76c503a/at76c503.c:
	  /home/proski/src/at76c503a/at76c503.c:2806 assertion dev->istate
	  == INIT failed/home/proski/src/at76c503a/at76c503.c:
	  /home/proski/src/at76c503a/at76c503.c:2777 assertion dev->istate
	  == SCANNING +failed

	  To prevent this, scanning should not be allowed when the
	  interface is down.

	* at76c503a/at76c503.c: vel Roskin <proski@gnu.org>:

	  The current CVS version of ignores ESSID settings.  When ESSID is
	  set using iwconfig, the device reports that it's disconnected,
	  and then associates to a random AP in the range, even it its
	  ESSID is different.

	  The simplest test is to set ESSID to a non-existing string (e.g.
	  "non-existing") and see it associate.  It happens whenever the
	  interface is up.  ESSID can be set when the interface is up or
	  down.

	  The fix it to set ESSID length properly

	  to commit (Pavel should know what he's doing ;o) ).

2005-03-08 04:33  jal2

	* at76c503a/at76c503.c: replaced usb_unlink_urb by usb_kill_urb for

2004-10-14 05:21  jal2

	* at76c503a/: at76c503.c, at76c503.h: - version 0.12beta21 - iwlist
	  wlanx scanning: fixed bug which showed only parts of the result:
	  it seems like iwlist is polling by SIOCGIWSCAN, i.e. invoking
	  _get_scan,   which must return -EAGAIN if the scan is still
	  running.  - introd. SCAN_POLLING_INTERVAL and poll faster to
	  decrease startup time

2004-10-14 03:58  jal2

	* at76c503a/: at76c503.c, at76c503.h: version 0.12beta20, fixed

2004-08-29 15:41  jal2

	* at76c503a/: at76c503.c, at76c503.h: - version 0.12beta18 - added
	  support for international roaming - added support for
	  "pseudo-monitor" mode, i.e. Kismet displays	the contents of
	  beacon and probe responses   (both items thanks to the patch by
	  Balint Seeber) - removed polling for scan completion in kevent()
	  - this will	hopefully remove the temporary system locks in
	  managed mode	 when no AP is found. Removed RESCAN_TIME etc.

2004-08-27 00:41  jal2

2004-08-14 02:45  jal2

	* at76c503a/at76c503.c: *do_probe(): firmware 0.90.x (Intersil)
	  shows error "control timeout on ep0in"   when querying the
	  firmware version from the device and a subsequent call to

2004-08-14 02:42  jal2

	* at76c503a/Makefile: - version 0.12beta16 - removed -g for 2.6.x
	  build (make the .o .ko files smaller) - install: don't rename old

	  (and all *.orig)

2004-08-13 04:17  jal2

	* at76c503a/: Makefile, at76c503.c, at76c503.h: - version
	  0.12beta15 - added support for >= 2.6.8: USB subsys will
	  disconnect after the device is   reset. We get reconnected
	  afterwards with the internal fw loaded (only), which	 we can
	  recognize by a failure in getting the firmware version.    added
	  new state WAIT_FOR_DISCONNECT, added new KEVENT_RESET_DEVICE

2004-08-11 03:10  jal2

	* at76c503a/at76c503.c: take USB_CTRL_GET_TIMEOUT from the kernel

	  removed "iwpriv wlan0 list_bss" command

2004-03-18 01:35  jal2

2004-03-16 23:15  jal2

	* at76c503a/at76c503.c: - treat ' ' as a cloaked SSID, too -
	  rx_mgmt_beacon: write \0 after copying the SSID

2004-03-16 18:23  njones

	* at76c503a/at76c503.c: Some code cleanups: - removed a stray
	  comment near the top - Improved the debugging output in the
	  _get/set_encode iw_handlers

2004-03-16 18:06  njones

	* at76c503a/at76c503.c: Changes made based on information from
	  Jean, both in _get_scan: - When returning ESSID information,
	  flags = 1 -> SSID on,   flags = 0 -> SSID off/any - With the
	  encoding information, we add to the flags: | IW_ENCODE_NOKEY
	  This indicates that the encryption keys are not returned as part
	  of the   scan information.

2004-03-15 20:27  njones

	* at76c503a/at76c503.c: Passing through the various TODOs embedded
	  in the code.	Some TODOs have been removed because fixes were
	  made or it was agreed that no changes were needed in those cases:
	  - handle_scan: used EPERM as a more suitable return code if the
	  device is   found to be in the wrong state when this function is
	  called - _get_range: max/avg_qual.qual is set to zero unless the
	  board has an	 intersil radio chipset.  - min/max_r_time settings
	  removed as the device doesn't support these.	- _set_scan now
	  returns a more appropriate error code.  - in get essid and
	  nickname handlers, 1 is added to the length of the   returned
	  string to include the '\0'.  This is the same behaviour as
	  displayed by iwconfig when these values are set.

2004-03-14 19:02  njones

	* at76c503a/at76c503.c: - Cleaned up a lot of the mess that was
	  present in the spy handlers.	The   code is a bit more pleasant
	  to look at now

2004-03-13 16:43  njones

	* at76c503a/at76c503.c: - In the ioctl for SIOCGIWSPY, fixed up the
	  process of copying the data	back to user space.  Frankly it was
	  absurd before - my fault.  The whole	 array of spy statistics is
	  translated in one go.

2004-03-13 16:24  njones

	* at76c503a/at76c503.c: Changes centre around the TODOs that were
	  left in the iw_handler code.	- Removed several TODOs that I felt
	  were no longer relevant - in get_rts, rts->disabled = (rts->value
	  >= MAX_RTS_THRESHOLD); rather   than == MAX_RTS_THRESHOLD

2004-03-11 21:40  njones

	* at76c503a/at76c503.c: - yet again, removed the copy_from_user
	  stuff from the SET_DEBUG private   ioctl.  This should work now
	  because the private ioctl commands have   been renumbered as
	  suggested by the comments in net/core/wireless.c   copy_from_user
	  should be done before this function is reached and this
	  function should work properly now.	If it doesn't, Joerg is
	  going to kill me!  - Because the private ioctl command number is
	  used as an index into the   table of private ioctl functions, and
	  Because the private ioctl command   numbers have been changed in
	  at76c503.h, it is necessary to insert   'gaps' in the private
	  ioctl function table so that the functions match   the new
	  command numbers.

2004-03-11 21:31  njones

	* at76c503a/at76c503.h: - 'setter' iw_handler command codes must
	  have an even value, otherwise   they will not be set up and
	  called properly from the wireless subsystem

2004-03-10 00:13  jal2

	* at76c503a/at76c503.c: fixed the bug in iwpriv wlanX set_debug
	  again, copy_from_user seems to be needed (at least on 2.4.23)

2004-03-09 21:57  njones

	* at76c503a/at76c503.h: - Removed one remaining trace of the
	  SET_AUTH_MODE ioctl

2004-03-09 21:56  njones

	* at76c503a/at76c503.c: - Removed all traces of container_of.  It
	  was quite a silly idea to use it   on a union in the first place
	  (duh!).  Union member is now cast back to   the union in the
	  calls to the kernel provided spy functions.  - Removed some
	  remaining traces of the SET_AUTH_MODE private ioctl - disabled
	  the set_retry iw_handler as it is uncertain whether the retry
	  parameter is settable at all on this device - used offsetof to
	  replace a creative exploitation of the C language - in the
	  SET_DEBUG ioctl, transferring data->pointer from userspace is
	  not needed as it will already be done at this point, either
	  within   at76c503_ioctl if the ioctl interface is being used, or
	  within the   wireless subsystem if the iw_handler interface is
	  used.

2004-03-08 02:30  jal2

	* at76c503a/: at76c503.c, at76c503.h: - authentication mode is now
	  determined by the open/restricted param of   encr/key in iwconfig
	  (open = open system, restr = shared secret) - removed
	  dev->wep_excl_unencr field, unencrypted data is now always
	  excluded   if WEP is active

2004-03-08 01:45  jal2

	* at76c503a/at76c503.c: added define container_of if not defined in
	  some include

2004-03-08 01:09  jal2

	* at76c503a/at76c503-i3861.c: added device IO-DATA WN-B11/USB

2004-03-07 21:16  njones

	* at76c503a/at76c503.c: Quite a big patch, but all changes are for
	  the same purpose: to allow the driver to compile under older 2.4
	  kernels: - Added macros to only include iw_handler.h if
	  WIRELESS_EXT > 12, if < 12   a definition of EIWCOMMIT
	  EINPROGRESS is needed.  - Macro definition for both conditions:
	  IW_REQUEST_INFO   = struct iw_request_info if WIRELESS_EXT > 12,
	  else = void since the   iw_request_info struct doesn't exist for
	  WIRELESS_EXT <= 12 - Fixed instance where usb_fill_bulk_urb was
	  being called directly   instead of via the FILL_BULK_URB macro -
	  Changed all instances of struct iw_request_info to
	  IW_REQUEST_INFO,   see above - All iw_handlers now take the
	  iwreq_data union member rather than the   iwreq_data object
	  itself.  This is to simplify things for older   versions of the
	  kernel (< 2.4.19) where iwreq_data did not exist and	 all the
	  ioctl payload types were defined in a union called 'u' inside
	  iw_req.  Not only does this save us using preprocessing for the
	  iw_handler function headers, but it also allows the code inside
	  the	handlers to be a bit cleaner as well.  I cant remember what
	  the	official C standard dictates, but my understanding tells me
	  that	 a pointer to a union can be used transparently as a
	  pointer to any   of the members of that union at runtime
	  (although the compiler will	complain about the function headers
	  being inconsistent), so even	 though the wireless subsystem will
	  pass a iwreq_data to our   iw_handlers, inside the handlers, we
	  can treat the pointer as a   iw_point or iw_param or whatever
	  inside.  - Changed all calls to the iw_handlers in the ioctl so
	  that the union   member is passed as the 3rd parameter, rather
	  than the union.  This   is done because in kernels < 2.4.20,
	  iw_req-> does not have a type.    (see above)

	* at76c503a/at76c503-fw_skel.c: - struct usb_bus->bus_name and

2004-03-02 19:27  njones

	* at76c503a/at76c503.c: -Fixed a pointer arithmetic bug in
	  iwspy_update.  I was only able to spot  this when compiling under
	  a 2.4.20 kernel.  Perhaps this is due to less  sensitive compiler
	  flags used for 2.6 kbuilds -Used macros to hide calls to the
	  kernel thrspy functions, when those  functions are not present
	  -Removed the NULL entry in the table of private iw_handlers.
	  This was  not clever at all because with the NULL entry, the
	  table of handlers did  not match the table of arguments to the
	  handlers.  -Added a SIOCGIWTXPOW entry to the ioctl switch
	  statement, with  corresponding iw_handler call -Fixed silly typo
	  in SIOCGIWRETRY

2004-03-02 19:13  njones

	* at76c503a/at76c503.h: -Removed PRIV_IOCTL_SET_AUTH_MODE macro and

2004-03-01 18:41  njones

	* at76c503a/at76c503.c: -Re-arranged some comments.  The comment in
	  SIOGIWSPY displays the number of  entries AFTER the list has been
	  parsed, rather than before, which makes  much more sense -ioctl
	  function is now handed to the net device in all cases.  It will
	  be  up to the wireless subsystem to decide whether to use the iw
	  handlers or  the ioctls, which of course, it is designed to do.

2004-03-01 00:58  jal2

	* at76c503a/at76c503.c: - iw_handler: added txpower (15 dBm) in
	  RANGE and SIOCGIWTXPOW (to get rid   of some error msg by "iwlist
	  XXX txpower" - fixed bug in "iwpriv wlan0 set_debug" - "iwlist
	  XXX scanning": report more than 8 bitrates from an access point

2004-02-29 23:20  jal2

	* at76c503a/at76c503.c: - fixed bug in dbg(DBG_RX_BEACON, ...) -

	  X scanning

	* at76c503a/at76c503.c: Fixed up an oversight in handle_scan that
	  caused the driver to become useless because it halted after a
	  scan.

	  Left some debugging code in rx_mgmt_beacon.

	  SIOCSIWSCAN now returns the mode of each AP and an encryption
	  enabled flag.

	  When setting up the netdevice, we enable either iw_handlers or
	  ioctls, but not both.

2004-02-28 18:10  njones

	* at76c503a/at76c503.c: Moved the process of doing the scan out of
	  the _SCAN Kevent, and placed it in it's own function.  This
	  function can now be called with flexibility from the scan
	  iw_handler.

	  Scan set and get iw_handlers implemented to a basic level (it
	  compiles).  Added these functions to the table of standard
	  iw_handlers and to the switch in the ioctl.

	  Some statistics about the beacons cannot be retrieved because
	  this driver in it's current implementation doesn't keep those
	  statistics.  In future, I will look at how we can obtain and
	  store that extra information in the bss_info structure.  Also,
	  thought needs to be given to whether the scan will stay
	  synchronous, as it is now, or whether we will use a kevent.

	* at76c503a/at76c503.c: Placed locks around sections where spy data

	* at76c503a/at76c503.c: General improvements to separation of spy
	  related functionality based on the version of wireless extensions
	  available at compile time.

	  In particular, the messy #if's in the table of standard
	  iw_handler table have all been removed from this location and
	  moved to inside the iw handlers.

	  This makes things a bit cleaner.

	  Added implementation of spy statistics recording for WIRELESS_EXT
	  > 15 in the iwspy_update function

2004-02-26 19:48  njones

	  get_wireless_stats

2004-02-24 19:57  njones

	* at76c503a/at76c503.h: Added #include for iw_handler.h, added new

	  messages   * new macro dbg_uc for "unconditional" debug output -
	  fixed bug in changing the MAC address with firmware 1.101.x

	* at76c503a/: at76c503.c, at76c503.h: added tx padding

2003-05-01 23:48  jal2

	* at76c503a/: Makefile, README, at76c503.c, at76c503.h: - version
	  0.10beta1 (it's a major change) - Makefile: target install does
	  not compile anymore, use target all before - redesigned BSS list
	  handling: an entry now times out and is removed after
	  BSS_LIST_TIMEOUT (curr. 120 seconds) after the arrival of the
	  last beacon.	- new iwpriv command list_bss: dumps the bss list
	  to syslog (temporary command,   until we have iwlist).

2003-05-01 23:15  jal2

	* at76c503a/at76c503.c: This change fixes the problem with
	  re-loading the driver while the device stays powered (and keeps
	  its firmware). The problem was that downloading the external
	  firmware twice was fine with 0.90.x firmwares but fails with
	  0.100.x and 1.101.y. This change simply ignores the error
	  USB_ST_STALL during downloading the external firmware.

2003-04-26 00:21  jal2

	* at76c503a/at76c503-rfmd.c: added BenQ AWL-400 USB stick device

	* at76c503a/: at76c503-i3861.c, at76c503-rfmd.c: added new devices

2003-04-13 21:22  jal2

	* at76c503a/fw-rfmd-1.101.0-84.h: this version shall fix the JOIN
	  timeout when connecting to an 802.11g access point (i.e. an AP
	  whose OpRates list in the beacon is longer than 5 rates)

2003-04-13 01:18  jal2

	* at76c503a/at76c503-rfmd.c: added Actiontec 802UAT1 device (info
	  provided by Martin Garton)

2003-04-09 01:30  jal2

	* at76c503a/at76c503.c: added more debugging to track lock-up
	  problems; don't rescan in ad-hoc when we lost the beacon of the
	  peer

2003-04-05 20:58  jal2

	* at76c503a/usbdfu.c: fixed bug hanging SMP systems (hopefully)

	  device

2003-03-30 15:10  jal2

	* at76c503a/scripts/fwbin2h: a tool to convert binary firmware
	  files (e.g. from Windows drivers) into C header files extracting
	  the version info

2003-03-28 01:25  jal2

	* at76c503a/: at76c503.c, at76c503.h: - fixed bug with restart
	  triggered by iwconfig: It seems that the STARTUP command must not
	  be sent while the device is busy with some other cmd (e.g. SCAN -
	  which takes a long time to complete).  The device got confused,
	  it did not send any AuthReq, only ProbeRequests until it got a
	  power cycle (guess some internal variables got mixed up and were
	  only resetted with internal firmware reload).

	  - added compilation time and cvs Id of at76c503.c into syslog

2003-03-23 00:27  jal2

	* at76c503a/: README, at76c503.c: iwconfig now restarts the device
	  with new params immediately -> no need for ifconfig calls anymore

2003-03-22 20:45  jal2

	* at76c503a/: at76c503.c, at76c503.h: replaced array dev->bss[] by
	  a linked list of struct bss_info (to work in env. with a lot of
	  BSS, e.g. CeBIT :-)
